Linking – attach data to a sample wherever that data happens to live.

:meth:`Project.attach_folders` handles the tidy case: data already laid out as
``<Modality>Data/<SampleID>/`` under the project root.  Real campaigns are not
tidy.  The micrographs are on the microscope's share, the beamline wrote its
own tree on another mount, and the spectra are in whatever folder the student
made that afternoon.  None of it is going to move, and copying it would create
a second copy to keep in sync.

So the organiser links instead of collecting::

    project.link("CuAu05", "uvvis", "/mnt/specs/CuAu05/*.csv", stage="synthesis")
    project.link("CuAu05", "tem",   "/mnt/scope/session17/")
    project.link("CuAu05", "waxs1d", ["/beamline/2024_3/w1.dat"])

Three forms of *source* are accepted and they mean different things:

=================  ==========================================================
a glob string      stored as :attr:`Measurement.pattern` – a **live** query,
                   re-expanded at read time, so files added later appear
a directory        listed **now**, filtered by the modality's extensions, and
                   stored as explicit paths – a snapshot you can audit
a path or a list   stored verbatim as explicit paths
=================  ==========================================================

Use :func:`link_folder` when you want a directory to stay live:
``link_folder(..., "/mnt/scope/session17", pattern="*.tif")`` records the glob
rather than the listing.

Paths are recorded **exactly as given**.  Nothing is rewritten relative to the
project, because a store that has been rewritten is a store that only works on
the machine that wrote it.  Portability is handled the way the rest of the
package handles it – with an alias.  Each link registers one for the mount its
data sits on (``/mnt/data32 → /mnt/data32``), which is a no-op here and the one
line to edit on the next machine::

    project.add_alias("/mnt/data32", ["/nsls2/data"])    # elsewhere
